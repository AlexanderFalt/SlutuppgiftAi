# Project Title

AI-Based Personal Energy Advisor

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

An AI assistant that helps individuals reduce household energy consumption by analyzing their smart meter data and recommending optimized usage patterns, appliance upgrades, or behavioral adjustments. 

## Background

The growing concern about climate change and energy costs calls for smarter, personalized energy use. Many households have access to smart meters, but lack the insight to act on the data.

* Problem: Households generate energy data but rarely optimize based on it
* Problem: Consumers often don't know which behavior or appliances waste energy
* Personal motivation: I want to reduce my carbon footprint and help others do the same
* Importance: Addressing climate and cost challenges with everyday tech

## How is it used?

The solution would be available as a mobile/web app where users connect their smart meter account or manually upload usage data. The app would:

1. Analyze historical consumption
2. Compare usage to similar households
3. Suggest specific actions (e.g. "run laundry after 9 PM," "replace fridge")
4. Track progress over time

Users: Homeowners and renters with access to usage data.

## Data sources and AI methods

* Data: Smart meter APIs (e.g. Green Button), appliance catalogs (e.g. EnergyStar), weather data
* Techniques: Clustering for user segmentation, time series analysis, regression models, and natural language generation for advice

| Data Source       | Use                         |
|------------------|------------------------------|
| Smart meter data | Usage pattern identification |
| Appliance specs  | Suggesting upgrades          |
| Weather API      | Context-aware recommendations|

## Challenges

* Privacy concerns with energy usage data
* Limited access to standardized APIs across countries
* Cannot control behavior, only advise
* Needs user trust to act on suggestions

## What next?

* Build MVP using open energy datasets
* Partner with utility providers for API access
* Add community comparison and gamification
* Incorporate solar/battery optimization
